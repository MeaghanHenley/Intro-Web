For my design I chose the 70's for the soft color pallet it had. I especially liked the flower graphic that was given. I then went through the other images including the flower image to gather my color pallet for the page and like to chose a different color for each section of texted I had. The colors I chose were...
rgb(254, 223, 83); for the background, I like how the yellow captures the viewers eye quickly
#669884;
was for the text for the title to add the 70's feel of the soft colors to bring in the calming vibe of the 70's
 #CD7A2C; was picked for the background of this text box to bring in the yellow text and it had that shag carpet feel to it which reminds me of 70's things.
