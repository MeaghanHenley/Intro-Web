      <li> 1 teaspoon Mexican Spice Blend </li>
      <li> 1 red onion, chopped </li>
      <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
      <li> 1 cup frozen corn, thawed </li>
      <li> 5 canned whole green chiles, seeded and coarsely chopped </li>
      <li> 4 canned chipotle chiles, seeded and minced </li>
      <li> 1 (28-ounce) can stewed tomatoes </li>
      <li> 1/2 teaspoon all-purpose flour </li>
      <li> 16 corn tortillas </li>
      <li> 1 1/2 cups enchilada sauce, canned </li>
      <li> 1 cup shredded Cheddar and Jack cheeses </li>

<li> <em> Garnish: chopped cilantro leaves, chopped scallions,
  sour cream, chopped tomatoes </em> </li>
</ul>
<h2> Directions </h2>

<ol>
  <li> Coat large saute pan with oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper.
 Brown chicken over medium heat, allow 7 minutes each side
 or until no longer pink. Sprinkle chicken with cumin, garlic powder
  and Mexican spices before turning. Remove chicken to a platter,
 allow to cool. </li>

<li> Saute onion and garlic in chicken drippings until tender.
Add corn and chiles. Stir well to combine. Add canned tomatoes,
 saute 1 minute. </li>

 <li>Pull chicken breasts apart by hand into shredded strips.
   Add shredded chicken to saute pan, combine with vegetables.
    Dust the mixture with flour to help set. </li>

<li> Microwave tortillas on high for 30 seconds.
  This softens them and makes them more pliable.
   Coat the bottom of 2 (13 by 9-inch) pans with a ladle of enchilada sauce.
   Using a large shallow bowl, dip each tortilla in
    enchilada sauce to lightly coat. Spoon 1/4 cup chicken mixture
    in each tortilla. Fold over filling, place 8 enchiladas in each pan with
    seam side down. Top with remaining enchilada sauce and cheese. </li>

<li> Bake for 15 <abbr title="minutes"> min </abbr> in a preheated 350 degree F oven until cheese melts.
   Garnish with cilantro, scallion, sour cream and chopped
   tomatoes before serving. Serve with Spanish rice and beans. </li>
 </ol>
