  <p> Come Fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away <br />
    If you can use some sxotic booze, there's a bar <br />

    Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away <br />
  </P>
  <br />
  <P> Come fly with me, let;s float down to Peru <br />
    In llama land, ther;s one man band, and he'll <br />
    toot his flute for you <br />
    Come on, fly with me, let's take off in the blue <br />
  </p>
  <br />
  <p> Once I fer you up there, where the air is rarefied <br />
    We'll just glide, starry-eyed <br />
    Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near <br />
    You may hear all the angles cheer because we're together <br />
    <p />
    <br />
    <p> Weather wise, it;s such a lovely day <br />
