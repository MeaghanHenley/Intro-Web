# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Meaghan Henley
I have decided to take this class for a few reasons. For starters it was requirement for my major, I am in the BFA program. Another reason for attending this course is I'm not that confident when it comes to this type of technology. Through this course I would like to gain some confidence in educating myself how web design works and how to use it properly.

- I was surprised to learn how the internet and the web are two different things.
- It was cool to know the first message was sent from UCLA.
